# Fork the Repository

üç¥ Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right. This creates a personal copy of the project you can work on.

# Clone Your Fork

üì¶ Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the git clone command:

```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/lobe-chat.git
```

# Create a New Branch

üåø Create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your work organized and separate from the main codebase.

In fact, this repo uses `develop` as the most up-to-date branch, where `main` is a stable production branch.

From your local repo, assuming you're on `main`,

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/develop
```

# Run Locally

üíª You will need Firebase API keys to run this application. Check out the [Next.js Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) documentation. Firebase API is required in the client browser, so prefix everything with `NEXT_PUBLIC`.

Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory and put the API keys in.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

# All Magic is Yours

üåü Time to work your magic! Write your code, fix bugs, or add new features. Be sure to follow our project's coding style. You can check if your code adheres to our style using:

```
next lint
```

# Open a Pull Request

üöÄ Time to share your contribution! Head over to the original Lobe Chat repository and open a Pull Request (PR). Our maintainers will review your work.

# Review and Collaboration

üëì Your PR will undergo thorough review and testing. The maintainers will provide feedback, and you can collaborate to make your contribution even better. We value teamwork!

# Celebrate

üéà Congratulations! Your contribution is much appreciated and part of the remake of Leetcode
